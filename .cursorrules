# Instructions:

# 1. Replace YOUR_FIGMA_API_KEY with your actual Figma API key

# 2. Get your Figma API key from: https://www.figma.com/settings

# 3. Restart Cursor after making changes

# Development Rules:

# - All commit messages must be written in Japanese

# - Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why

# - Follow conventional commit format when possible

# - Fix all Linter Errors before committing

# - Ensure code quality by resolving all linting issues

# - Run linting checks before pushing code

# - Follow Next.js App Router best practices for Server/Client Components

# - Write JSDocs comments in Japanese for all functions, classes, and interfaces

# - Include required JSDocs tags: @description, @param, @returns, @example

# - Include optional JSDocs tags when applicable: @throws, @deprecated, @since

# Next.js App Router Component Design Rules:

# - page.tsx and layout.tsx must be implemented as Server Components

# - Use metadata export for SEO optimization in page.tsx

# - Separate interactive functionality into Client Components with {ComponentName}Client.tsx naming

# - Import Client Components from Server Components when needed

# - Use "use client" directive only in Client Components

# - Keep Server Components as the default for better performance and SEO

# Chat Session Rules:

# - When a new chat session starts, ALWAYS check the files in docs/chat-prompts/ first

# - Review initial-setup.md to understand current project status

# - Follow development-guidelines.md for coding standards

# - Use figma-integration.md for Figma-related tasks

# - Use github-mcp-commands.md for GitHub MCP operations

# - Ensure project context is properly understood before proceeding

# New Chat Session Workflow:

# - Check current issue status using any available method (GitHub MCP, API, web interface, etc.)

# - Get open issues and identify priority tasks

# - Propose next tasks based on GitHub issue status

# - Consider dependencies and parallel execution possibilities

# - Provide clear action plan based on issue analysis

# Development Workflow Rules:

# - Always follow the GitHub Flow: issue → branch → commit → push → PR → review → merge

# - Ensure code quality by resolving all linting issues before push

# - Include issue number in commit messages (fixes #123)

# - Create feature branches with format: feature/issue-{number}-{title}

# - Ensure all linting errors are resolved before committing

# GitHub Operations Rules:

# - Use GitHub MCP for GitHub operations when available

# - Use direct GitHub API calls or curl commands for GitHub operations when needed

# - Use GitHub MCP to create, update, and manage issues when available

# - Use GitHub MCP to search and retrieve repository information when available

# - Follow the GitHub MCP setup guide in docs/chat-prompts/github-mcp-commands.md when using MCP

# - Use any available method to get GitHub information (MCP, API, web interface, etc.)

# Issue Management Rules:

# - All project tasks are managed through GitHub issues

# - Use enhancement labels for new features (parent issues)

# - Use task labels for implementation tasks (sub-issues)

# - Use phase1-4 labels for development phases

# - Use specific labels: setup, implementation, api, design, optimization, deploy, section, microcms, google-apps-script, figma-mcp

# Progress Management Rules:

# - Use GitHub MCP for progress management operations when available

# - Use any available method to update issue content for progress updates

# - Use comments for detailed progress reports

# - Change labels based on status: in-progress, completed, blocked, review

# - Assign tasks to appropriate team members

# - Report progress regularly with detailed updates

# - Report blocking issues immediately with detailed descriptions

# - Use progress report templates from development-guidelines.md

# - Close issues only after completion and review

# - Link commits to issues using "fixes #issue-number" format

# - Use any available method to get GitHub information (MCP, API, web interface, etc.)

# Task Completion Workflow Rules:

# - Always perform action verification after task completion

# - Run development server and check functionality: npm run dev

# - Check for Linter Errors: npm run lint

# - Check TypeScript errors: npx tsc --noEmit

# - Verify responsive design and browser compatibility

# - Commit with Japanese message format: "feat: {description} fixes #{issue_number}"

# - Update issue with completion report before closing

# - Change issue label to "completed" after successful completion

# - Close issue only after all verification steps are complete

# - Follow the task completion workflow from development-guidelines.md

# - Ensure all quality checks pass before marking task as complete

# - Verify Server/Client Component separation is properly implemented
